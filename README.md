## Numpy Repo-
The IMQAV framework provides an overview of data science, and an understanding of NumPy's rule:
1. Ingest - Ingestion is a set of software engineering techniques to adapt high volumes of data that have arrived rapidly, often via streaming. Ingestion is sometimes necessary when there is a mismatch between the volumes of data and or the rates, which are sometimes referred to as the velocity of data, are generated.
  -Kafka
  -RabbitMq
2. Model - data model
  - Realtional - Mysql
  - Key value - Redis, DynmoDB(AWS)
  - Cloumnar - HBase, Hana DB
  - Document - MongoDB, Elastic search
  - Graph - Neo4j.
3. Query - Get the data
  - Batch - Mapreduce, Spark.
  - Batch SQL - Hive
  - Straming - Storm
4. Analyze - here come numPy
  - Statistics 
    - R, SAS, Scipy, Panda
  - Optemization and mathematical modeling - 
    - SciPy
  - Machine Learning 
    - SparkML, H2o
    - Scikit-learn(interactive)
5. Vizualization - 
  - kibana, pandas, matplotlib, D3, tableau
